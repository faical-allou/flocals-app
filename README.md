# flocals-app

This app requires an endpoint that you can find [here](https://github.com/faical-allou/flocals) if you want to run your own.
You can also use the current herokuapp running here: 'https://flocals.herokuapp.com' with the caveat that it is not maintained, goes to sleep after 30min of inactivity, is load restricted and could be terminated anytime.

To get started you also need a few external accounts (both are freemium):
+ Expo: https://expo.io/
+ React Native: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/
+ firebase: https://firebase.google.com/
+ GCP: https://cloud.google.com/
  where you need to enable: 
  * Places API
  * Translation API

and a bunch of dependencies that can be installed with *yarn* or *npm*
